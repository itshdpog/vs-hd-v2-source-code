Day 17839728: Its been so long since ive seen someone. Only person i have is me.
Im getting so close to escaping, its almost finished. Im almost out. Its been so long, i miss him.
MVP Carrot is the only thing i have, If somebody takes it away i might aswell kill myself. I wont let anyone stop me, im too far gone.
I also think im hallucinating at this point, Ive began seeing... Him but with strangely no pupils. I Just want all of this to be a bad nightmare.
This stupid book is all that i have right now besides the carrot, I cant wait for it to be finished
